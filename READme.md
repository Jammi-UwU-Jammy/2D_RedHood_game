#2D Game, project
Jam Clark

<h3>I. Guide:</h3>
<p>Because this is a project during which I explored the 2D game design, it doesn't have the extravagant stuff such as story or loading
screen. Mostly, it is to build the functionalities of a game and less focus on the completion.</p>
<div>
    <li>Movements: arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Attack: key A.</li>
    <li>Jump: key W.</li>
    <li>Loot: SPACE & close distance to the drops.</li>
    <br>
    <li>To equip an item, open bag and click on it. The random stat will apply, check the top-left corner.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Portals: Top-middle heals the player's HP, middle-right teleports player to the new map.
    <li>The new map's only portal teleport player to the previous map.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The quests the in the middle-top of th screen</li>
    <li>When the quest is completed, it is auto cleared and a sound is played.</li>
</div>

<h3>I. Known issues:</h3><p>(updated 12/14)</p> 
<div>
    <li>The AI doesn't always arrive at destination. Sometimes the path is updated due to the 2s cycle and the remaining distance 
        keeps getting messed up by it. This results in the glitchy images and enemy sometimes never arrives.</li>
    <li>Enemies sometimes get stuck in between trees due to non-uniform-shaped obstacles/blocks</li>
    <li>Mages and Samurais' heights are much larger than character's, so it seems like they stand below the player</li>
    <li>Samurais don't have death animations. They weren't in the package.</li>
    <li>Can only equip and not unequip.</li>
    <li>There is no handle for character's death.
